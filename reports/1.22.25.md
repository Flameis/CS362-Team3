# Status Report 2025-01-22

## Team Report
<!-- status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project standup meeting -->

### Last Week Goals

- [x] Create a 4-page slideshow presentation
- [X] Create a PM board on Trello @Jake-Thompson
- [x] Update Living document
- [x] deliver zip with presentation and Updated Living document ðŸššcanvas
- [x] TA meeting scheduled

### Progress and Issues

<!-- The second subsection reports on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck -->

- We had a hard time getting our TA meeting schedule but eventuly got it worked out
- We had to scrap our first project idea and come up with a whole new one and be ready to present it, we made it through though

### Goals

<!-- The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress. If tasks from one week arenâ€™t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
For the weekly report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, itâ€™s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.  -->

- start UI design
- start DB design
