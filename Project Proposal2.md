## Communication Channel and Rules


# Product Description


## Abstract

This project is a plant identification app for the Oregon State University campus. Users will take pictures of plants around campus, identify them, and upload them to a website that will show a map of campus with the locations of each identified plant. There will be layers to the map for each season, so users can see what plants are in bloom at any given time. Each plant, when clicked on, will show details of the plant that the user provides. The website will have a social media aspect with features such as commenting and liking plants.


## Goal



## Current Practice



## Novelty

The novelty of this project is that it will be a social media plant identification app specifically for the Oregon State University campus. The botany department curretly has a [tree inventory map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=097214a28e934a7681e229b41c9e0d29), but it is specific to trees and is simply a inventory system. Our app will be a user driven plant identification system that will allow users to identify and map plants on campus themselves, as well as drive social interaction based around the plants. 


## Effects



## Technical Approach

The idea is to use a SQL database that holds each plant identified by the users. The website will display a map and overlay each plants location using google maps API and querying the database through code. We are still deciding on how exactly we will build the website.
