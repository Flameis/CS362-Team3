# Setting Up Beaver Botanica

Open two of your operating system's terminal windows, and navigate to <parent-path>/CS362-Team3/demo in both. 
Run the following command in one window:

```npm install```

Once this finishes running, you're almost ready to view Beaver Botanica! Make sure you are on the OSU WiFi or connected to the OSU VPN before continuing.

Run the following command in one window:

```npm run api```

And wait for it to finish running executing.
In the other terminal window run:

```npm run react```

This will open Beaver Botanica in your browser! Happy plant hunting!
