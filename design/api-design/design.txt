GET:  /api/plants/{id}
    ->  {status: int, data: data}

POST: /api/plants/add
    * must be authenticated
    <-  data  # fields that can be null can be left undefined
    ->  {status: int, id: int}

POST: /api/plants/edit
    * must be authenticated
    <-  data  # only changed data if no change then undefined
    ->  {status: int, data: updated_data}

POST: /api/plants/delete
    * must be authenticated
    * for non mods force=true is an error  #? maybe also for restore=true # maybe the only the user who flagged it can restore it? (mods can always restore)
    * for mods to full delete must also send force=true.
        * this way mods can still flag for delete if needed
    + force=false   sets delete flag   (default)
    + force=true    fully deletes
    + restore=true  removes delete flag  (implied default is false)
    + force==true && restore==true is an error
    <-  {id: int, force: bool|undefined, restore: bool|undefined }
    ->  {status: int}

Note: for any status there can also be msg: or maybe name it message:  (probably only set for errors? or could always set it)
Note: data and updated_data are of type "javascript Object"
