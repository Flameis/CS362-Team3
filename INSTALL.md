# Installing Beaver Botanica
Welcome to Beaver Botanica, your new go-to tool for exploring and discovering the amazing plant life at Oregon State University! 

You can visit our website at [flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:8070/map](http://flip1.engr.oregonstate.edu:8070/). Our project is entirely web-based, so you don't need to install anything to be able to use our platform! If you have a relatively recent smartphone with an up-to-date web browser, you should be able to navigate to our service without error. If you do not have access to a computer or smart device, you can also take advantage of Oregon State University's free computers at the Valley Library! 

To learn more about how to use our platform, visit our [user documentation page](https://github.com/Flameis/CS362-Team3/blob/main/project-docs/User_Documentation.md).
