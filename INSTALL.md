Your project repository should contain a file INSTALL.md. that describes how to install and use your software. If it's a website or web-based application then the document should provide a URL. If it's a mobile app, then the document should describe how to download and install it. If it's a desktop application then the document should describe how to download and install your application. This document should provide details of the dependencies one needs to have installed for running your software. Assume that the user of your application knows nothing about your software and provide as much detail instructions as possible.
