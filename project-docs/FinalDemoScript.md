## Registration and Login
First up is registering an account with Beaver Botanica, which can be done by entering an email address, and then setting a username and password. 
Then, we can sign in with the account and view our details.

## Map
Next up is where most of Beaver Botanica’s features are, the map.
Here you can see pins dropped for each plant entry in our database, which you can click on to view more information about.
When viewing a plant entry, you can look at the user made description, its location, the season the plant was found in, as well as any images that users have taken!
You can also give a rating to the entry, comment on it, or even report entries that are incorrect or are offensive.

Going back to the map, you can also filter the pins on the map, allowing you to find where your favorite plants are!


## Adding a Plant Entry
If you want to add a plant entry to the map, you can do so by pressing anywhere, then clicking the “Place Plant” option at the top of the screen, and entering any information about that specific plant, including species, description, location, season and a link to an image of the plant.
You can then view the entry immediately.

## Verifying Plant Entries

When users enter information, we want to make sure that moderators can look at plant entries and remove or correct any that need it.

Here is an example of a moderator going to the plant entry we just submitted and verifying it.
