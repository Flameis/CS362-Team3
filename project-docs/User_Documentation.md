# User Documentation

## Overview 
The OSU Plant Map is a web application designed to help users identify and locate plants on the Oregon State University campus. Users can identify plants by taking pictures of them and uploading the images to a database that shows the locations of plants on campus. The platform has a movable map interface with seasonal layers, enabling users to explore which plants are in bloom at different times of the year. Botany students can quickly find and study plants without the need to explore the campus kindly. Visitors and nature enthusiasts can discover and learn about the unique flora around OSU. Faculty and researchers can use it to track plant diversity and contribute data. General users can engage through social media features such as commenting and liking plant posts.
