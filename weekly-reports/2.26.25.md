# Status Report 2025-02-26

<!-- filename format is YYYYMMDD.md -->

<!-- Both sections should have the following three subsections. Each subsection is best organized as bullet points, though you can write a paragraph instead.   -->

## Team Report
<!-- status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project standup meeting -->

### Last Week Goals
- [x] Continue to add functions to webpage.
- [x] Link database to webpage.
- [x] Create event listeners for client to server.
- [x] Finish draft of User Documentation.
- [x] Finish draft of Developer Documentation.

### Progress and Issues

<!-- The second subsection reports on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck -->

- We made a lot of progress linking our frontend with our backend. We have a rudimentary implementation of our website available on the flip servers. We created a way to add new plant instances. We created automated testing inside of GitHub.
- We're currently having a bit of trouble with completing integration of the frontend and backend, and need to communicate more. It has been challenging to achieve our goals for this project, while simultaneously balancing our lives, mental health, other group projects, and careers.

### Goals

<!-- The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress. If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
For the weekly report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.  -->

- Pass the class.
