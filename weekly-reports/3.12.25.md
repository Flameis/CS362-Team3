# Status Report 2025-03-12

<!-- filename format is YYYYMMDD.md -->

<!-- Both sections should have the following three subsections. Each subsection is best organized as bullet points, though you can write a paragraph instead.   -->

## Team Report
<!-- status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project standup meeting -->

### Last Week Goals
<!-- The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It is empty for the first week -->


- [x] Complete the poster for our presentation
- [x] Record a demo of Beaver Botanica
- [ ] Pass the class

### Progress and Issues

<!-- The second subsection reports on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck -->

- We were able to finish the poster on time, and we made a demo for our project. We got a large majority of the requirements done, and feel generally satisfied with the work we've put into our project.
- However, we were very confused about the test case requirements. We did not know if we had to automate the tests, or if they whould be manual. We also were confused about the number of test cases we should have.
- Overall, our team is feeling burnt out and ready to be done with this class.

### Goals

<!-- The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress. If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
For the weekly report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.  -->

- [ ] Present our project demonstration.
- [ ] Pass the class.

- I had a really difficult time this week, as my car died and I had to find transportation. I didn't get as much documentation done as I would like, but I did complete the poster to the best of my ability. I also got really sick over the weekend and have been feeling burnt out and miserable.

- This week has been a lot. Definitely not as bad as what Kathryn is going through, but with how much as I had to work on for my other classes I have not had the time to be able to sit down and work on documentation. I did what I could, but I certainly am not proud. I also commandeered presenting the solution so I can get my free participation points. I am way too used to presenting to people now.
