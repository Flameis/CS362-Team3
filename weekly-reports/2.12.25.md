# Status Report 2025-02-12

<!-- filename format is YYYYMMDD.md -->

<!-- Both sections should have the following three subsections. Each subsection is best organized as bullet points, though you can write a paragraph instead.   -->

## Team Report
<!-- status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project standup meeting -->
- **MUST** have detailed description of the work we've accomplished on Trello and the weekly reports, especially if some members put work into a Google Docs that was then transferred to a GItHUb Markdown file.
- Be VERY clear what sections you worked on in the technical document. ASsigning everyone to "complete the report" isn't going to cut it. In the weekly report, make sure to describe in detail the work you completed on technical documentation or website design.

### Last Week Goals
<!-- The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It is empty for the first week -->

{{copy from prev week ### Goals}}
- Worked on Midterm Presentation and Report
- Create a basic UI website by Friday (find a high-quality image of OSU map)

### Progress and Issues

<!-- The second subsection reports on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck -->

-

### Goals

<!-- The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate. You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress. If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
For the weekly report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.  -->

- Add basic webpage functions.
- Implement database.
- Create event listeners for client to server.
- Create a event listeners for client to server.

- I spent my time working on the UI design for the presentation, but I didn’t get a chance to work on the report. I originally thought the report and the script were the same thing, so I didn’t realize I needed to work on both separately.
- Looking back, I wish I had managed my time differently, but now that I understand the difference, I’ll make sure to allocate time for both moving forward!

- I worked on the problem, solution, and front-end architecture of the presentation. I only did the problem and solution sections for the report. I wish I was able to do more for that part of the project, but due to a miscommunication, I was under the impression that the script and the report were the same. Despite that, I am happy with the work I was able to accomplish.
- I hope to be able to work more on the front end this week, but with a midterm on the horizon, I doubt I can do much.

- I plan to work on implementing the login/signup functionality, which will allow users to create accounts and access personalized features. Additionally, I’m looking into enabling a search feature and filter options on the main webpage to improve usability. The search feature will help users quickly find specific plants, while the filter options will make it easier to narrow down results based on different criteria.

- I hope to work on basic features of the front end. Most importantly, I hope to create a few menus. At the very least I want to make one. Having a side menu was something that was considered very important in the design process, so I hope to be able to help in the initial implementation of that.
